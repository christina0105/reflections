When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    与他人进行协作时

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    对拉取了哪些更改心中有数

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    远程代码库之间用fork，远程代码库和本地代码库之间用clone，分支是针对不涉及代码库之间的传递。

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    这样可以对远程分支在原来基础上做了哪些修改心中有数

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    (⊙o⊙)…

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    直接在master分支上操作会更省事。但是独立分支进行操作更有利于协作，可以在合并前知道所有人都做了哪些更改。
